											<p>Every educational system is based on some philosophy. We who have inherited the Salesian educational system may therefore ask: what is the philosophical basis of our system? It is a well known fact that Don Bosco was not a theoretician. He never elaborated a complete and organic educational treatise, nor did he ever express his educative method in a completely systematic way. Still, Don Bosco did have theoretical interests, and was interested in pedagogical problematics, even though not in an academic way.Clearly, he did have a method, and it is recognized that his educative efforts did form a system.
<br>
<br>
“Preventive System as the Preferential option for the poor” has impelled us in all our educative interventions at the school and college levels. The same choice now calls us to provide diploma courses to the youth in Basin Bridge,a large slum whose inhabitants are settlers from rural Tamil Nadu and from the neighboring states and who had come in search of employment. , disadvantaged because of poor economic and social conditions.
<br>
<br>
We are called to accompany the young in the crucial moments of their life. Technical study is a time in their life in which they make the more important decisions for their future. Vocational orientation in the fundamental choices of their life or profession is required most at this stage.

There is a need for a presence of the Salesian Congregation in those environments in which social change, especially in relation to youth is being promoted. We spend so much of our time, energy and means in reacting, counteracting and correcting negative youth culture. Preventive System calls us to be present in the very places where such culture is created.

<br>

Don Bosco Polytechnic College is engaged in a Technical reflection on the Salesian educative system, both in theory and in practice, and its interface is with the world of technology and culture, as an attempt to make a specifically Salesian contribution in the field of education.
